These mods route the servo and/or motor wires underneath the Adapter Plate for a CLEAN look and away from moving belts.

Scale Shield - this mod has 2x cutouts on the left and right side for user preference. If you're using HayaminiNL's controller board side case (or my updated/modded version), the front cutout is for the servo wires, and the rear cutout is for the motor wires.

Feeder Plugs - Print these plugs to fill the unused cutouts in the modded scale shield.

Adapter Plate - 3a - holes large enough for the servo/motor JST plugs, and holes for mounting Dirtbit's display controller housing while using my modded                         controller board side case.
                      3b - servo and motor JST holes only; NO holes for mounting display controller.

Motor and Servo Wires Plug - OPTIONAL; small plugs if you want to tuck the wires even closer; I designed them but typically don't use them.

Case Body Bottom - Hayamini's design, but I modded the back holes to fit JST plugs through.

Case Body Top - Hayamini's design, but I modded the serial port opening wider to allow room for the studs for attaching the serial cable.
