Ball Powder Bearing Plate - This works with Version 1 & 2 of the OpenTrickler!! I enlarged the openings slightly, added a 60 degree chamfer, and removed the bearing reliefs. This is a modified V2 plate, so there is a larger opening around the V1 fine trickler tube, which is completely OK if your bearings are sealed. IF YOU ARE INSTALLING IN A VERSION 1 TRICKLER, YOU MUST PRINT THE VERSION 2 VOLUME REDUCER AND REAR DOOR TO GO WITH IT! I prefer my modded rear door with 0.4mm spacer for a nice, snug fit.

I have used this plate very successfully with LeverEvolution and CFE223. It is easy to clean afterwards with a small blower and a toothpick or small paint brush.
