I have made both Version 1 and 2 of the OpenTrickler, and it's my all-time favorite 3DP project. I've included a Version 2 cutout of the bearing plate on this homepage to test your bearing fit before printing full pieces, as I believe the bearing test should be your very first print. You can quickly adjust your X-Y Hole Compensation if needed before committing a large amount of your filament to the main pieces. EAMARS designed some bearing tolerance, so I recommend starting with zero Hole Compensation and go from there.

I've included some of my personal mods and my mods of other contributors. Have a look around and see if anything jumps out.

I also have some free designs if you're interested in additional 3DP reloading/precision tools on Printables: https://www.printables.com/@DIY_Dewey
